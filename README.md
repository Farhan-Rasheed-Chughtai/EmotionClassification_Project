This project focuses on classification of textual data used to express emotion of a person. Our project tries to solve an NLP problem by designing an efficient machine learning model written in python to be able to distinguish these different emotions expressed. 

Models Used:
We used five machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Feed Forward Neural Network and Bidirectional LSTM recurrent Neural Network to achieve this goal.

Results:
Bidirectional LSTM was identified as the best performing model with a F1-score of 0.89 for all the classes.
